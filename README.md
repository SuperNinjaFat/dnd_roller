# dnd_roller
Use an ESP8266 to send dice roll commands to the DiceParser bot on an RPG discord server.

Designed to work in conjunction with this bot https://top.gg/bot/279722369260453888

Turn the dials to change the dice type and dice amounts and press the button on the top to send the message. For instance, setting it to roll two 10 dice will output "!2d10", which then is parsed by the dice bot.


I came up with this idea when I was participating in a DnD session through discord with wireless earbuds. Whenever it got to my turn, I felt too lazy to open my phone/pc to roll the dice, and thus this project was born.
